# Identify the amount of waste that you recycle.

To approach this question in the CFP app, I would think that we would need a multiple choice select input field for the users. In this multiple choice we would list out all 6 of the categories in the recycling field. Depending on the length of the amount that is selected, you would then multiply that number by 4 and subtract it from 24 to get the total points. We would make this field not required, which would signify that they do not recycle and get the 24 points added to the score automatically.
