# Traditional Functions

Yes I understand the scope of functions and how they can be useful when calling them and returning values. I think the review helps by showing how the scope of functions work as well as how it effects the variables inside the functions. For instance if we were to create a variable inside of a function, we won't be able to reference it in another scope unless we were manipulating a global variable or returning a value that could be used within another function. It's helping to cover return and note that we need to set the value when we call the function so when the function runs and returns a value we can then use it later on.

The IIFE functions are interesting I have actually never seen them before. Its cool that the function invokes itself on the runtime so you don't need to call it later, but I can see where it could cause some trouble not having the arguments that may be passed through defined in time could pose some errors later on.
