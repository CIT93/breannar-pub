1. Create an actual decision. This app is not making any decisions it's just a list at this point. I think I need to create a calculator for each day and see how much time is left within the day.
2. Finish functionality for reminder. Move away from alert and instead incorporate it into page. Maybe I should incorporate this into the activity.js instead of its own module?
3. Add some more styling to the page for fun!
